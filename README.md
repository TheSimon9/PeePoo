# PeePoo

I'm looking for a tool to help me monitor the contents of my child's diapers. This can be quite valuable for tracking his growth and ensuring his health.

There are probably several tools that can serve this purpose, though it's all in good fun! 💩

Please feel free to share your suggestions, borrow the idea, or just have a laugh at my project 😎.

## Local develpooment

You'll need a supabase account or a running [local supabase instance](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development)
.

Create a file named `.env.local` with the following properties and your Supabase account values  🫶🏻:
 
    SUPABASE_URL=https://something.supabase.co
    SUPABASE_KEY=eyJh.....
  

Then in order to start dev env:

    npm i
    npm run dev

Easy Peesy 💦
