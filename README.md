# PeePoo

I'm looking for a tool to help me monitor the contents of my child's diapers. This can be quite valuable for tracking their growth and ensuring their health.

There are probably several tools that can serve this purpose, though it's all in good fun! ðŸ’©

Please feel free to share your suggestions, borrow the idea, or just have a laugh at my project ðŸ˜Ž.

## Run

In order to start dev env:

    npm i
    npm run dev

Easy Peesy ðŸ’¦

    - [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - a React framework for production.
